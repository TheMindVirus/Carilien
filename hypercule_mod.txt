[hypercule_mod]
machine 1: googol gear milometer - half phases intermediate numbers
machine 2: stepper motor gearbox - requires electrical input control
machine 3: threading w/o threads - constrained by interleaved interlocking cores

machine 4: dynamo planetary gear - prone to slipping and recalibration required
machine 5: edge mode select gear - requires low error phase locked loop circuits
machine 6: binary counter dialer - extremely difficult to produce correctly

machine 7: matrix mixer exchange - may encounter oddities and physical errors
machine 8: differential commuter - unintentionally reverses polarity of drive
machine 9: metronomic regulation - fixed intervals with no or little deviation

"dialer" -> "wire fibres" -> "exchange circuits" -> "more wire fibres" -> "generator"

6: dialer and somewhat generator
7: is also machine 3 internally which is a transformer inductor
8: wire fibres and more wire fibres usually made from copper but also optics
9: endpoints switch between 1 pulse and 2 pulses with sync on regular metronomic intervals

9 - hypercule synchrotron
8 - double zero generator
7 - sawtooth arpeggiator
8 - double zero generator
6 - hypocule mellotron

machine 1 is in search of machine 0 and machine 4 is in search of infinity but only finds & space

machine 6 dials machine 9 via machine 3/7 connected through machine 8/8

which machine 8/8 interfaces with is controlled by z-height

mainly:
* binary counter gearbox as opposed to googol gear milometer from lego gears
* threading without threading in python native def instructions and function calls
* exchange machine aggregator which recognises which addresses to multicast from incoming signals
* ultimately forms a telephone exchange network of content in a content delivery network
* also happens to look like multiple parallel spinning rotors with symbols on them
