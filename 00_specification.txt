[00_intro]: Dial 00 for Bug Reports

Carilien is a dystopian video game universe set deep within the bowels of
a telephone exchange which later became the basis of the Combine in canonical Valve lore.

The theme colours are dark green, rust, yellow and black for signage with white handwritten text.
The industrial grunge aesthetic is visible on most 1970's portal 2 levels and in other games.

The main character is "caroline" but her name badge and all her belongings state her name as
"carilien" due to an admin error while entering her name into a database at early Aperture.

The main character is female and has recently incurred brain damage with some amnesia
and cannot as an engineer herself remember where she is or what job she was assigned.

The overarching message from the Aperture Science engineers is "Don't Build GLaDOS"
whereby the chamber of GLaDOS is still under construction and needs several repairs.

The tests occur within the confines of an Aperture Science Carilien Hypercule
where a hypercule is a spherical wireframe mesh into which test chambers are usually built.

There are remnants of the project to expand the then arpanet into something much wider
ranging a span of multiple continents worldwide to share telegram messages internationally.

The basis for the current build is a Portal 2 level designer map file .bsp package
with some compatibility ranging into expansions such as Portal Reloaded and Revolution.

A future build of the game may feature PDP-11 devices hosting engineering minigame puzzles
and more directly resembles the telephone exchange gantry elevator where the game is set.

cave johnson: "...allegedly speaking of course, I have no idea how any of that stuff is supposed to actually work in practice..."
cave johnson: "...I will personally see to it that an aperture science dedicated engineer, after moments of stark realisation, will figure out how that actually happens."
carilien: "i'm like them ... and they're like me ... no ... wait ... i am them ... "
cores: "{chorus} and we're you."
carilien: "... ! ... but ... that's my name ... ! ..."
carilien: "... 'CAROLINE' ..."
